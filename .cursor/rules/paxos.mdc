# Paxos Crate Rules

Multi-Paxos consensus library with signed proposals. TLA+ specification in `spec/MultiPaxos.tla`.

## Architecture: Pure Core + Async Runtime

State machines are pure (no I/O, no async):
- `AcceptorCore` - pure acceptor state transitions
- `ProposerCore` - pure proposer phase tracking

Async runtime wraps the pure cores:
- `AcceptorHandler` / `run_acceptor` - network I/O for acceptors
- `Proposer` / `QuorumTracker` - network I/O for proposers

This separation enables model checking with Stateright using the same logic.

## Safety Invariants

These MUST be maintained (verified by TLA+ spec):

1. **Agreement**: At most one value learned per round
2. **Quorum**: Strict majority required: `n/2 + 1` acceptors
3. **Proposal ordering**: `(round, attempt, node_id)` lexicographic comparison
4. **Promise integrity**: An acceptor's promise is always >= any accepted proposal
5. **Strict Prepare-before-Accept**: No leader optimization - each Accept requires a prior Prepare for that exact proposal

## No Leadership Optimization

This implementation does **not** use Multi-Paxos leader optimization. Every round requires:
1. Phase 1 (Prepare) - proposer gets promises from a quorum
2. Phase 2 (Accept) - proposer sends Accept only for the promised proposal

Accept is rejected unless the exact proposal was previously promised. This prevents a "leader" from sending Accept for new rounds without first running Prepare.

## AcceptorStateStore Requirements

Implementations of `AcceptorStateStore` MUST:

1. **Atomicity**: `promise()` and `accept()` must be atomic per-round
2. **Persistence before returning**: Persist state BEFORE returning success (use fsync)
3. **Reject if not promised**: Accept only succeeds if `current_promised == proposal`
4. **Reject dominated accepts**: Reject if a higher proposal was already accepted
5. **Crash recovery**: Reload state before accepting new requests after restart

```rust
// Accept requires exact promise match
let not_promised = current_promised.is_none_or(|p| *p != proposal);
let dominated = current_accepted.proposal > proposal;
if not_promised || dominated { reject }
```

## Quorum Tracking

Use `QuorumTracker` to detect when quorum is reached. Quorum = `n/2 + 1`.

## Proposal Keys

Proposals are compared by `ProposalKey<P>` which orders by `(round, attempt, node_id)`. Never compare proposals directly - use `.key()`.

## Testing

Use Stateright for model checking Paxos invariants against the TLA+ spec.
